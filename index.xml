      <description>Mentorship Program The Mentorship Program is an initiative aimed at supporting other Iranians who are either prospective UBC students or wish to apply to UBC in the next few application cycles. As part of the program, mentees will be paired with current UBC undergraduate or graduate students to learn about educational resources, specifics about studying at UBC, community involvement strategies, and housing and finance information.
